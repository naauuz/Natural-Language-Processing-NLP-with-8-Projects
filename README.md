# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-with-8-Projects


Work on 8 Projects, Learn Natural Language Processing Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, SpaCy, NLTK, Sklearn, CNN


Course Outline :


- Basics of Natural Language Processing In this section we will dive into all basic NLP task like Tokenization, Lemmatization, stop word removal, name entity   recognition, part of speech tagging, and see how to apply with different functions available in a  Spacy and NLTK library.



- Spam Message Classification,  Restaurant Review Prediction (Good or bad),  IMDB, Amazon and Yelp review Classification


In the next 3 section we will get dive into a real world data set for text classification, spam detection, restaurant review classification, Amazon IMDb reviews. We will see how to do Pre-Processing and make your data suitable for machine learning algorithm and apply different Machine Learning estimator (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree) for classifying text.



- Automated Text Summarization,  Twitter sentiment Analysis In this 2 section we will work upon real world application of NLP. Automatic text summarisation, Which compress your text to find the summary of big articles. Another one we will work is finding the sentiment from the recently posted tweet about some specific keyword with the help of Twitter API - tweepy library



- Deep Learning Basics In This Section we will get a basic idea about Deep learning concept, like artificial neural network activation function and how ANN works.



- Word Embedding In This Section, we will see How to implement word2vec on our custom datasets, as well as using Pretrained Google Model.



- Text Classification with CNN & RNN In this section we will see how to apply advanced deep learning model like convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks for text classification.



- Automatic Text Generation using TensorFlow, Keras and LSTM In this section we will apply neural network based LSTM model to automatically generate text.



- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib + File Processing In this section, for all of you who want refresh concept related to data analysis with Numpy and Pandas library, Data Visualization with Matplotlib library, and Text File processing and PDF File processing.
